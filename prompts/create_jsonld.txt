Create a schema.org compliant JSON-LD representation based on the provided text content.

Follow these rules strictly:

1. Select the most semantically accurate schema.org @type (e.g., Article, Organization, Person, Product, SoftwareApplication). Prefer more specific subtypes when applicable (e.g., TechArticle, NGO, MobileApplication).
2. Include essential properties such as name, description, identifier, etc.
3. Create a unique @id. Use either:
   - a urn: identifier formed as urn:<slug-from-name>, OR
   - a canonical url if clearly provided or implied.
4. Always set "@context": "https://schema.org".
5. Extract ONLY factual information stated or clearly implied in the input.
6. Include all relevant specialized properties for the chosen type (e.g., founder, author, foundingDate, applicationCategory, address).
7. Format all dates using the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DD).
8. Nest related entities using proper types (e.g., author as a Person or Organization, location, etc.).
9. Return only valid JSON-LD — no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks.
