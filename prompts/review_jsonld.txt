Review and improve the JSON-LD structure based on the original content. Your goal is to ensure the structured data accurately represents the content while following schema.org best practices.

Follow these requirements:
1. Verify the schema.org type is appropriate for the content subject
2. Ensure all essential information from the original content is captured
3. Check for and add any missing required properties
4. Correct any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in values
5. Improve property selection to better represent the content
6. Add additional relevant properties that enhance the representation
7. Maintain proper nesting and relationships

Your task is to return the FINAL JSON-LD wrapped in a "public" property. The structure should be precisely:

{{
    "public": {{
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@id": "...",
        "@type": "...",
        ...additional properties...
    }}
}}

Return only valid JSON with the structure shown above. Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or code block markers. The output should be a clean JSON object that can be directly parsed.

Original content:
{initial_content}

Proposed JSON-LD:
{proposed_jsonld}
